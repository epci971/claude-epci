## Score Calculation

```
Final Score = Σ (criterion_score × criterion_weight)

Example:
- Objective: 4/5 × 10% = 8
- Role: 5/5 × 10% = 10
- ...
- Total = 82/100
```

---

## Contextual Application

Not all criteria apply systematically. Select relevant criteria based on:

| Prompt Type | Priority Criteria |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Simple prompt | 1, 4, 7 |
| Business prompt | 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 |
| Complex prompt | All 12 |
| Creative prompt | 1, 2, 7, 10, 11 |

If criteria are not applicable, recalculate weights to 100% with retained criteria only.
