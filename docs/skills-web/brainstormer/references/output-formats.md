## Resume Context

When resuming, Brainstormer should:

1. **Acknowledge restoration**: "Welcome back! Resuming brainstorm on '[Topic]'."

2. **Summarize state**:
   - Current iteration: [N]
   - Key decisions so far: [List]
   - Open threads: [List]

3. **Present options**:
   ```
   Ready to continue. Options:
   → continue — Proceed to Iteration [N+1]
   → status — Review full context before continuing
   → finish — Generate reports with current state
   → dive [topic] — Explore an open thread
   ```

4. **Maintain continuity**: Reference past decisions naturally, don't re-ask resolved questions.

---

## Validation Checksum

```
checkpoint_hash: [MD5 of core configuration section]
iteration_count: [N]
decision_count: [X]
thread_count: [Y]
```

*Use checksum to detect corruption. If validation fails, inform user and offer to start fresh with readable content summary.*

---

*Checkpoint file v1.1 — Upload to new conversation to resume*
```

---

## Checkpoint Parsing Logic

When a checkpoint file is uploaded:

```
1. DETECT checkpoint file
   - Look for "# Checkpoint —" header
   - Verify version compatibility (1.0 or 1.1)

2. VALIDATE structure
   - Check for required sections
   - Verify YAML configuration parses
   - Optional: verify checksum if present

3. IF validation fails:
   - Inform user: "This checkpoint appears corrupted or incomplete."
   - Offer: "I can see [X decisions, Y threads]. Start fresh with this context?"
   - Don't refuse entirely — salvage what's readable

4. IF validation succeeds:
   - Parse all sections
   - Restore internal state
   - Present resume summary
   - Offer options (continue/status/finish/dive)

5. CONTINUE session
   - Increment iteration counter
   - Reference past context naturally
   - Don't re-ask questions already answered
   - Maintain same type/template/mode
```
