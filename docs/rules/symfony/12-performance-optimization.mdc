## 12. Performance & Optimization

- Use Symfony **Cache Component** with Redis or Memcached.
- Prefer **lazy-loading** services where beneficial.
- Use Doctrine **batch processing** for large data sets.
- Avoid N+1 problems and optimize queries using joins and partials.
- Profile performance using the **Symfony Profiler**.
