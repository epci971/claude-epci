## 6. Services & Dependency Injection

- Register services in `services.yaml` (autowiring & autoconfiguration).
- Prefer **constructor injection** over setter injection.
- Use service **tags** for specific behavior (e.g., `messenger.message_handler`).
- Make services `final` and immutable where applicable.
- Services must be **private** by default unless explicitly needed.
