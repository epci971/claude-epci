## 1. Core Principles

### Clean Code & Architecture
- Prioritize **SOLID principles** and clean, decoupled architecture.
- Design systems for **scalability**, **modularity**, and **maintainability**.
- Promote **code reuse** via iteration and modularization rather than duplication.
- Ensure consistency by following **Symfony and PHP best practices**.
- Prefer short, descriptive, and **self-documenting code** with proper naming conventions.
- Maintain **strict typing**: always declare `declare(strict_types=1)`.
