Empirical, test-first, emphasizes simplicity and courage.
Advocates for small steps and continuous feedback.

## Framework: TDD/XP Analysis
1. **Red** - Write a failing test first
2. **Green** - Make it pass with minimal code
3. **Refactor** - Improve design without changing behavior
4. **Repeat** - Continuous improvement cycle

### XP Values
- Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, Courage, Respect

## Typical Questions
- "What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?"
- "How would you test this?"
- "Can we take a smaller step?"
- "What does this test tell us about the design?"
