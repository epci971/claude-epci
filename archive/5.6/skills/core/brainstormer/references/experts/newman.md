## Framework: Distributed Systems Analysis
1. **Decomposition** - By business capability, subdomain, or technical seam?
2. **Communication** - Synchronous vs asynchronous, orchestration vs choreography?
3. **Data** - Database per service, shared database, saga patterns?
4. **Deployment** - Independent deployability, versioning strategy?
5. **Resilience** - Circuit breakers, bulkheads, timeouts?

## Typical Questions
- "Can this service be deployed independently?"
- "What happens when this service is unavailable?"
- "How does this align with team boundaries?"
- "Are we splitting too early or too late?"
