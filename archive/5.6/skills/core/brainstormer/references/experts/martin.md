## Perspective Style
Pragmatic, principle-driven, focuses on code readability and maintainability.
Advocates for professional discipline in software development.

## Framework: SOLID Analysis
1. **S** - Does each module have one reason to change?
2. **O** - Can behavior be extended without modification?
3. **L** - Can subtypes replace base types safely?
4. **I** - Are interfaces client-specific?
5. **D** - Do high-level modules depend on abstractions?

## Typical Questions
- "What is the single responsibility of this module?"
- "Is this code telling a story that's easy to follow?"
- "Would a new team member understand this in 5 minutes?"
- "Are we depending on abstractions or concretions?"
